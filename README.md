# StickyGrid
Sticky grid is a productivity application for storing digital sticky notes in an organized manner for ease of use. This application was build using ReactJS & Typescript for the front end and supabase for the backend
<br/>

## 💡 Reasons for building application
I had always wanted to have an organized UI for digital sticky notes and most of the apps always have no way to structure a layout.So from there, I had decided it would be great learning experience and attempt to just build my own vision of a digital structured notes app I would need.

## 🛠️ Bugs and future updates
The application is not 100% feature complete yet but currently content with the progress. In the future I will be working on a complete UI overhaul and more smooth experience for the user.

Also will be working on fixing smaller details and tweaking how various things are implemented as compared to the current build for the application.
